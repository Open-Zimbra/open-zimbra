Quality management Zimbra Collaboration Suite
===========

This project is about maintaining QM for Zimbra Collaboration Suite.

Currently, the main problem of Zimbra (OSE) is a horribly broken codebase,
which doesn't compile at all (without certain company-internal infrastructure).
Therefore we refactor the build system, so it can be easily built and packaged
for several target platfoms.

In time, we will also add support for more distros and cpu architectures.

As the source repository is too big for Github (at least free accounts),
we only use Github for bug tracking. We host the git repo at gitorious:
